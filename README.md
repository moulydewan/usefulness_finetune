# Finetuning for Usefulness Project

This finetuned model code repo has been created as part of an experiment for finetuning LLMs on user search behavior signals to predict usefulness labels. The finetuning has been conducted on the dataset THUIR KDD'19 and details of the paper can be found in our paper 'LLM-Driven Usefulness Labeling for IR Evaluation':
